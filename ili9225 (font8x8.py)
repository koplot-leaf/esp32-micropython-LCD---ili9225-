#ili9225는 기본적인 폰트가 지원되지 않습니다. 그래서 'hi'라고 출력할때는 아래 h와 i를 정의 해야합니다
#그렇기에 이 파일에는 모든 알파벳과 숫자, 기호를 사용할수 있게 해줍니다
#이 파일도 저장 --> ~~(으로)저장 ---> micropython 장치 저장 --> font8x8.py 라고 이름을 지으세요

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#The ili9225 does not support a basic built-in font.
#Therefore, to display "hi", you must define the letters h and i as shown below.
#For this reason, this file allows you to use all alphabets, numbers, and symbols.
#Save this file --> Save As --> Save to MicroPython device --> Name it font8x8.py
